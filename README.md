BomberFriends is a multiplayer game that is inspired by the Bomberman franchise.

The game allows a player to control a character on a 2d map. The character can drop bombs. The bombs and player character can be augmented by power-ups that are revealed when a player destroys garbage 'blocks' that are randomly distributed throughout the map.

BomberFriends suppoers 2-player multiplayer.

I will use vanilla JavaScript and canvas to create the game. I will create classes for player-controller characters, maps, 'garbage blocks', and the bombs. I don't know how to create animation or even render 'sprites' so I'll have to research that and decide how I want to use it. Another issue is that I don't know how to write 'hit detection' for sprites. I know we used coordinates for asteroids but I'm not sure if that will work for this.
I'm also not completely sure about how to both render the map and have it communicate with the JavaScript that I've written, so that will probably be the first thing I need to get straight.
